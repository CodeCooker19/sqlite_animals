# NodeJS REST API SQLite

This project is a proof of concept (POC).  
It's purpose is to demonstrate an implementation of a NodeJS REST API using SQLite as a database (sqlite.db).   
The code is written in ES6 and uses Promises.

## Installation :

1. Clone this repository : `git clone https://github.com/streaming-dev/sqlite_animals.git`  
2. install its dependencies : `npm install`
3. install sqlite package if not find : `npm install sqlite3 --build-from-source`

## Requirements :

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you want to clone this repository.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the application.
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install dependencies (see the full list below at "Dependencies").
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test the API.

## Getting started :

1. Install this application (See Installation).
2. Start the server with : `node index.js`
3. Connect Postman to the API at : `http://localhost:3000`
4. Try the different routes of the API (For more details, see the [documentation](https://github.com/romwaldtff/NodeJS-REST-API-SQLite/wiki)).

Alternatively, you can use `node index.js YOUR_PORT_NUMBER` to start the server with a specific port.  

## Dependencies (installed via `npm install`)
